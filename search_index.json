powerful service mocking, recording, and playback utility.\n\n\n\nv0.x docs\nWhat problem does mockyeah solve?\nHelps decouple HTTP integrations throughout development and testing.\nTesting is difficult when you don't have control of your data. Developing service integrations can be a painful process. APIs designs are often influx, incomplete, unstable, or completely unavailable.\nmockyeah puts you in complete control, enabling you to implement real mock web services with ease to integrate and test with during development. Real mock services means you have control of response payloads, HTTP status codes, response latency, and more.\nHave a requirement to implement specific behavior when a service is slow to respond or a server returns an unexpected status code? No problem! mockyeah makes developing for such requirements easy.\nWhat is mockyeah's purpose?\n\nTo eliminate service side effects\nTo provide dependable integrations\nTo isolate application behavior\nTo increase developer productivity\nTo increase integration testing performance by eliminating network latency\n\nTo begin, see our Getting Started guide.\n"},"Getting-Started.html":{"url":"Getting-Started.html","title":"Getting Started","keywords":"","body":"Getting Started\nInstall\nnpm install mockyeah --save-dev\n\nor\nyarn add -D mockyeah\n\nIntroductory tutorial\n\nCreate an example project and initialized with NPM\n$ mkdir example-app && cd example-app\n$ npm init # all defaults will be fine\n\n\nInstall mockyeah\n$ npm install mockyeah --save-dev\n\nor\n$ yarn add -D mockyeah\n\n\nCreate script file and add the source below\n$ touch index.js\n\nconst mockyeah = require('mockyeah');\n\nmockyeah.get('/hello-world', { text: 'Hello World' });\n\n\nRun the script file with Node\n$ node index.js\n\n\nOpen http://localhost:4001/hello-world\n\nProfit.

Default fixture file location is ./fixtures in your project.\n\nhtml (String|Function|Promise; optional) - HTML to include in response body. Assumes response Content-Type of text/html.\n\njson (Object|Function|Promise; optional) - JSON to include in response body.

Content-Type is the default Express type if not specified in header.\ntext (String|Function|Promise; optional) - Text to include in response body. Assumes response Content-Type of text/plain.\n\nFor dynamic behavior, the noted methods above can also be defined as functions that return response body values.\nFor asynchronous behavior, they can be defined as promises that resolve with such values, or a functions that return such promises.\nThe functions will receive the Express request object as a first and only argument.\nExamples:\nmockyeah.get('/service/exists', { json: req => ({ hello: req.query.name }) });\n\nmockyeah.get('/service/exists', { json: req => Promise.resolve({ hello: req.query.name }) });\n\nmockyeah.get('/service/exists', { json: Promise.resolve({ hello: 'there' }) });\n\nAdditional options:\n\nheaders (Object; optional) - Header key value pairs to include in response.\nlatency (Number in Milliseconds; optional) - Used to control the response timing of a response.\ntype (String; optional) - Content-Type HTTP header to return with response.
